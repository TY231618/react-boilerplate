# React BoilerPlate

As I have been writing a few React apps I decided it was time to create a boilerplate so that I culd get up and running quickly.  I know you can use `create-react-app` but to understand the inner workings I wanted to create one from scratch

## Quick Start Guide

The repository is written in [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) as the package manager.

**To start the app:**
- To install dependencies, run: `npm install`
- To run: `npm run start` (by default this starts on [localhost:8080](localhost:8080))

## Vision

To understand the inner workings of how to create a React app

## What I learnt

* Setting up Webpack
